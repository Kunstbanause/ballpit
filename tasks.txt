There is a little space between the tiles where I cannot place buiuldings, the grid. Can we improve this by accepting drag and drops anywher within the play field.


Some buildings can only be placed once: I think all warfare and housing. Also market, workers guild. Also everything in economy but farm, Gatherers hut, goldmine, lumberyard



Some tiles are of different size. Like the advanded resource tiles are 1x1
